## Solution   

We found Geno ex's twitter in [this](music-signs.md) challenge. In the bio she has her spotify account and, for some, weird string. 

```
13yTaS2QsQi5Gy9M6cezHmyQtWhj4zW5aY
```

Before this string there's cash bag emoji. What has to do with money and is online? Probably crypto. 
Crypto currencies have wallet adresses. This specific doesn't start with `0x` so it's probably Bitcoin. Let's look it up on [Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/13yTaS2QsQi5Gy9M6cezHmyQtWhj4zW5aY).
There are two transactions assigned to her Bitcoin adress. After some time guessing and looking those adresses in the "bitcoin adress lookup" and stuff like that I just pasted one of adresses in the transaction, this one specifically `1FsXnPtqRtWs89YtDhFdoZpyt2LUWJDfW1`. 
One of the results is [this page](https://finance.ackaria.xyz/). 

I assumed that the name of the country is `Ackaria`, hence the flag is `RS{Ackaria}`.


Additionally in the bottom we can find this text:
