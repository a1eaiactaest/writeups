## Solution

In the description we are informed about missing name and his workplace.  
Let's search for `geno bridgewater` in google.  
We don't get much besides football player. Let's try searching on specific site.

```
geno bridgewater site:linkedin.com
```

First result we are presented with is [geno ikonomov's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geno-ikonomov/) linkedin site. 
Goal was to find the last name so the flag is:

```
RS{ikonomov}
```
